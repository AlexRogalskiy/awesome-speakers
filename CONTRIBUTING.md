Hello there!

Thank you for wanting to add more awesome speakers! How to add new speakers:

- Add people that you believe hold awesome talks (you can also add yourself ☺️)
- For privacy reasons, let people know you are adding them here ([example tweet](https://twitter.com/karlhorky/status/927550556570357760))

Format ([example pull request](https://github.com/karlhorky/awesome-speakers/pull/156)):

- An image (Twitter profile picture is best)
- Line 1: Name of the speaker
- Line 2: Topics they talk about, capitalized (future topics in parentheses)
- Line 3: Contact link (Twitter and GitHub accepted)

Also please always write backslashes at the end of Line 1 and 2 to create newlines in Markdown.

Thank you for reading!
